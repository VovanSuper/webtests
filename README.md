*webtests*
========

simple webtests for some real world web coding samples using node, css filter, svg, ko, jq, bt and stuff like dat.
Not supposed for production or any realworld usage.
  *images are gotten from zee internets and modified using ms expression design 4*

-------

Due to the thing that the bower downloading jq@2.x version, where,  I guess, fallbacks for supporting older browser (i.e IE<9) depricated, it has nothing for substitution of `.addEventListener()` , i.t `attachEvent()`, a polyfill should be used (in code, or I thought modernizr should solve dat)
